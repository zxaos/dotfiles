Some personal dotfiles in a repository so that I can bring them everywhere. Probably not of interest to anyone else.

To use the global gitignore, do `git config --global core.excludesfile '~/.dotfiles/gitignore_global'

## Hyper Key
To use hyper key, use provided private.xml in [Karabiner](https://pqrs.org/osx/karabiner) and map caps lock key to keycode 80 in [Seil](https://pqrs.org/osx/karabiner/seil.html.en). If pressing the remapped hyper key also presses escape, you forgot to unmap capslock in the standard keyboard preferences.

## PLists
Since Mavericks, simply replacing preferences plists is insufficient. You have to kick cfprefsd:
 * Try `defaults read ~/Library/Preferences/bundle.id.path`
 * Try `killall cfprefsd`
 * Try (with the program closed), `defaults delete bundle.id.path` (e.g. `defaults delete com.manytricks.Moom` )

## PopClip
Symlink plist to ~/Library/Preferences/com.pilotmoon.popclip.plist and the folder to ~/Library/Application Support/PopClip
